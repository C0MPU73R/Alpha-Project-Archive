# Alpha Project Archive
Compilation of screenshots, videos and texts from WoW alphas and betas.

If a folder called `UNSORTED` exists, that means that I need help sorting those images!

# Note about Videos
Videos are stored using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/), so if you don't want to use it, or don't know how, you'll need to download the missing videos one by one.
